Hi! I'm Nicolas

I'm currently pursuing a MSc in Computer Science and Engineering at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it), working on Real-Time Systems at the [HEAP Lab](https://heaplab.deib.polimi.it/).  
My main interests are Operating Systems, Compilers, System Security and Cryptography. Here you can find the projects
I've been involved with during my University years, both at Bachelor and Master level.

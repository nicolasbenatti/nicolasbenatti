## Welcome to my Academic repository! ðŸ“š

Hi! My name is Nicolas and I'm currently doing my MSc in Computer Science and Engineering at [Politecnico di Milano](polimi.it), Italy.  
My main interests are operating Systems, compilers, system security and every combination of the three. Here you can find the projects
I've been involved with during my university years, both at a Bachelor and Master level.
